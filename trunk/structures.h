/*DATA STRUCTURE FOR THE PLAYERS. The structure members are based on the communication protocol given to us.
* Im thinking that each player should be able to change his values, and then a specific function can be written that
* takes the structure and converts into a 32bit vector like in the communication protocol. This vector will then be
* sent to the server.
